# Unit 1 Project #
In this project you have the opportunity to create a piece of artwork using ASCII 
(American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Using the already created file 
named `ASCIIArt.java` write a program that outputs your artwork to the console. 
The goal of this project is to use ONLY what we have learned in Unit 1 to create 
anything you would like so be creative (and school appropriate). Artwork must also have a caption describing what it's depicting.  

For those of you who have dabbled in coding before, try to contain your code to 
just what we have discussed in this unit. 

## Example Output ## 
```
 _____________
< AP CS Rocks >

        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |

A cow exclaiming their love for computer science.                       
```

## Learning Targets ## 
I can demonstrate an understanding of procedural decomposition by writing static 
method declarations and calling them within other methods.

I can show my understanding of legal identifiers within the bounds of style guides 
discussed in class so far. 

I can produce a text output in the console using strings while understanding the 
proper way to display special string characters. 

## Requirements ##
Your code MUST:
* declare at least 4 static methods that are all called at some point in your code
* Static methods serve a purpose by reducing redundancy and increasing readability 
  of the code
* Adheres to proper style discussed in class so far
* Uses at least 2 special string characters

## Rubric (20 pts) ##
| Category | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|:--------:|---|---|---|---|
|Demonstrates Learning Targets (8pts) | Meets all targets | Meets only 2 | Meets only 1 | Doesn't show any attempt at the learning targets | 
|Creativity (4pts) | Demonstrates original looking work | | | Looks as thought it was copied off the Internet |
| Style (4pts) | Demonstrates a strong understanding with flawless style | Minor style errors | Demonstrates low understanding of style | Code is unreadable | 
| Executes Properly (4pts) | Runs without any errors | Compiles and runs, but output seems buggy | Doesn't compile but due to minor errors | Large syntax errors left in the code |
